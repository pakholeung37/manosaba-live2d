# Renderer refactor results — 2026-09-16

Apple M4, Godot 4.7.2 Mono, Forward+ / Metal, 1280×720, 20 independently
animated Mao instances. The project rendering backend remains unchanged.

| Metric | Original renderer | Refactored renderer |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Average FPS | 5.919 | 84.310 |
| P50 frame time | 175.271 ms | 11.752 ms |
| P95 frame time | 259.550 ms | 12.664 ms |
| P99 frame time | 283.365 ms | 14.034 ms |
| Draw calls, final sampled frame | 3,541 | 1,661 |
| Mask render targets | 320 | 20 |
| Godot-reported rendering memory | 4,411,637,760 bytes | 201,211,904 bytes |
| Mask resizes during final measurement | not recorded | 0 |
| Measured duration | 15.036 s | 45.000 s |

Both runs use 5 seconds of warmup, the same debug extension configuration and
the same model/Idle animation. The final run measured 3,794 frames. Render memory
is Godot's rendering counter, not process RSS. This is a local benchmark with
other desktop applications open, not a guarantee for arbitrary models or devices.

Final OpenGL Compatibility cross-check (same extension/shaders, 15 seconds):
117.101 FPS, P50 8.436 ms, P95 9.158 ms, P99 10.111 ms, 1,661 draw calls,
162,173,935 bytes rendering memory and zero mask resizes. Its batched-versus-
unbatched comparison also found zero sampled-pixel differences for all nine
states. Results are preserved as `artifacts/benchmarks/refactored-opengl.json`.

## Implemented changes

- One padded screen-resolution mask atlas per model, with bounded allocations,
  zoom hysteresis and off-screen suspension.
- One shared position texture and one drawable-parameter texture per model.
- Ordered adjacent-material geometry batches; shader, texture and draw order
  boundaries are preserved. Invisible drawables use zero alpha without rebuilding.
- Cached drawable state and contiguous array writes for batch construction.
- Correct negative-coordinate bounds and mask-source texture selection.

## Validation

- `tests/smoke_test.gd`: loading, motion/expression enumeration and UI controls.
- `tests/mask_allocation_test.gd`: small-model allocation, off-screen suspension,
  return to screen with mirroring and rotation.
- `tests/batch_render_test.gd`: same-frame batched vs unbatched render comparison,
  default state plus all eight model expressions. Final Metal run found zero
  differing sampled pixels in every state. This checks batching against the new
  unbatched renderer; it is not a pixel-exact comparison with Native or the old masks.

## Reproduce

```sh
/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --path /Users/pakholeung/web/manosaba-live2d \
  res://benchmarks/gd_cubism_20.tscn -- --seconds=45
```

Results and viewport images are written to `artifacts/benchmarks/latest.json`
and `latest.png`. The final Metal result is preserved as `refactored-metal.json`
and `refactored-metal.png` in that directory.

The extension source is in the sibling `gd_cubism` checkout; see its
`docs-src/RENDERER_REFACTOR.md` for the new shader contract. The debug framework
and all ten paired shaders have been copied into this project's addon. Existing
custom replacement shaders need migration before use with this renderer.
